I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Robotics and Automation Technologies at FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg. My core areas of interest are model-based reinforcement learning, contrastive representation learning, teleoperation, and tactile-haptic interfaces for robotic manipulation.

I earned my Bachelor's degree from Nagoya University, Japan, with a focus on Robotics and Control. Over the years, I've been fortunate to work on a variety of projects spanning robotics, signal processing, and haptics.

I also had the privilege of spending 3 months at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tubingen, Germany, advised by [Cansu Sancaktar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9JqNY7UAAAAJ&hl=en), [Marco Bagatella](https://marbaga.github.io/) and [Prof. Georg Martius](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=b-JF-UIAAAAJ&hl=en).
