Hello! I am a recent graduate of Nagoya University in Japan. I am currently doing an internship at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tubingen, Germany. I am interested at the intersection of robotics and natural language processing, especially how we can build intelligent robots that will need least of human supervision and operate via language instructions.     
  
My current research includes contrastive learning, 6D pose estimation, and tactile-haptic interfaces for robotics.
